# Setup

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently. Support is available to use either of the following two methods for accessing GPU-enabled cloud computing resources.

## Install
- Python 3
- NumPy
- TensorFlow 1.x
- Keras 2.x



you will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Your pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

Preprocess - You'll convert text to sequence of integers.
Models Create models which accepts a sequence of integers as input and returns a probability distribution over possible translations. After learning about the basic types of neural networks that are often used for machine translation, you will engage in your own investigations, to design your own model!
Prediction Run the model on English text.
